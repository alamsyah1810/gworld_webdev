            <br>
             

            <p>Not everyone can commit their entire desk area to a dedicated gaming PC setup, but for those who still want to drink deep at the well of PC games, it no longer feels like a dramatic compromise to go the route of the gaming laptop. For a long time, mobile GPUs struggled to keep up, and laptop heat would melt a desk if someone played a high-powered game for too long (at least, thatâ€™s what it felt like). Now, the balance is all upside with minimal compromise for most models in the market.</p>
            <p>One common victory is that the "best fit" resolutions for a good laptop experience very much suit the current state of graphics processing power. While large desktop monitors are reaching for 4K resolutions and beyond for lovers of the cutting edge, most laptops don't push past 1920x1080 (or 1080p) as a resolution, as the gains diminish pretty quickly on sub-20-inch screens. GPUs that fit inside a laptop have caught up to this pixel scale nicely and, in most cases, do a comfortable job of delivering 50+ frames per second at very high settings in all but the most demanding games. A number of laptop models also add the ability to boost GPU power using external devices so you're not locked into what's inside the case and can future-proof yourself to some extent.</p>
            <p>However, there are some areas where the compromises remain: Speakers can struggle to give an impressive sound, and fans can make a lot of noise as they keep the air moving through the limited space inside a laptop chassis. If you're gaming with a headset, both of these issues can be ignored pretty comfortably, but it's something to keep in mind.</p>

            <p>Gaming laptops have also gotten a lot thinner in the past three years. Some are still pretty chunky, especially the big 17-inch units, but compared to even just a few years ago, most of our picks have real potential to be nice, daily-use laptops that can also deliver a great gaming experience.</p>
            <p>We've played around with a lot of different models from a variety of manufacturers, and in this guide, you'll find our personal recommendations for the best gaming laptops currently available. We focussed on the pros and cons of form factor, any unique traits, and used the benchmarking tool found in Assassin's Creed: Odyssey to help us compare the graphical performance of the models we tested--these benchmark numbers give us a rough indication of the average frames-per-second performance on the unit.</p>
