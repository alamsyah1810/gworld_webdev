            <h3>November 26, 2019</h3>
            <br>
            
            <p>Although Jurassic World's Colin Trevorrow was fired from his role as director and co-writer of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, his contributions were great enough to earn himself a writing credit for the final film. As such, he will earn residual checks from the sci-fi blockbuster, and those are expected to be significant given the profile and popularity of the film.</p>
            <p>Trevorrow has now announced that he will donate this money to the Alexander Devine Children's Hospice, a UK-based charity that gives money and services to sick children. Trevorrow said donating his royalties is keeping in spirit with what he learned from Star Wars creator George Lucas.</p>

            <p>"Through his films, George Lucas taught us about our connection to all living things," Trevorrow said, according to Deadline. "He taught us to take care of one another, and he set a powerful example himself. The Alexander Devine Hospice helps families in the most challenging of times. I can't think of a more fitting way to honor George's legacy."</p>

            <p>The hospice's co-founder, Fiona Devine, said the charity is "blown away by this incredibly generous gesture." Trevorrow's donation is expected to be enough to pay for a nurse for a year, and this will allow the group to "continue to do this and importantly reach out to even more families that need us."</p>
            <p>"We cannot thank Colin Trevorrow and his family enough for their amazing support and generosity," Devine said.</p>
            <p>Trevorrow wrote multiple drafts for Episode IX alongside his Jurassic World writing partner Derek Connolly, who is also receiving a "story-by" credit for the movie. This confirms that the final Rise of Skywalker script included a significant enough amount of the work done by Trevorrow and Connolly, but it remains to be seen what that is. Abrams and his own co-writer, Chris Terrio, finished the story for Rise of Skywalker in their own way.</p>
            <p>Trevorrow told Empire Magazine that Abrams did a good job finalizing the Rise of Skywalker script. "This was a tough story to unlock, and he found the key," he said.</p>
            
            <p>"I'm grateful to [Abrams] for embracing some of our ideas. It's exciting that fans will get to see the moments that felt essential to all of us," Trevorrow added.</p>
            <p>When Abrams and Terrio started writing their new script for Rise of Skywalker, they decided to add Emperor Palpatine--something that Trevorrow said he "never considered."</p>
            <p>According to The Wall Street Journal, Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy was unhappy with the scripts that Trevorrow and Connolly turned in for Episode IX, and that's why they were fired.</p>

            <p>The Rise of Skywalker comes to theatres on December 20. If you like C-3PO, you're in for a treat, as the robot character is said to feature prominently in the film.</p>
