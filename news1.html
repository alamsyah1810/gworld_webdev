            <h3>November 26, 2019</h3>
            <br>

            <p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has a curious crossover coming on November 29, when the Spirit Board will replace the current Pokemon spirits with characters from a very different franchise. Resident Evil has had a big year on Switch--Resident Evil, 0, 4, 5, and 6 all released on Nintendo's platform--and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is looking to celebrate with this Spirit Board.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="Images/pic_news_1_1.jpeg" alt="" class="pic1">
            <br>
            <p>Chris, Jill, Leon, and Wesker will all come to the game as unlockable spirits, meaning that you can nab three of the series' mightiest heroes (and maybe its most iconic villain) if you've leveled up well and can beat their equivalent fighters. Unfortunately, this also means that Leon Kennedy almost certainly isn't the fifth DLC character included in the Fighters Pass, which recently added Terry Bogard to the game's roster. There are, however, more fighters in the works; it's not unthinkable that Resident Evil will eventually be represented in Smash Bros.</p>
            <p>Nintendo and Resident Evil have a curious history, with the Resident Evil remake, 0 and 4 all releasing first on the GameCube. Resident Evil 7 is available on the system through the Japanese eShop, but only as a streaming title. Resident Evil Revelations and Revelations 2 are also available on Nintendo's console, with the first having begun life as a 3DS game.</p>
